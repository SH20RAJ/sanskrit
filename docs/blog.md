 
# **Sanskrit **: Let's make sanskrit a programming language 🕉️💻  

---

## The "Aha!" Moment 🤯  

So there I was, staring at my screen, buried in yet another JavaScript project. You know the drill: `function`, `console.log`, `return`… same old stuff. And then 💡 BAM! A thought hit me:  

*"What if we could code in Sanskrit?*"  

Now, before you start laughing 😂, hear me out! Sanskrit isn’t just any language – it’s like the superhero 🦸‍♂️ of languages. Logical, precise, and deeply rooted in mathematics and philosophy. Even NASA thinks Sanskrit could be used in computing! Cool, right? 😎  

The idea became even funnier when I stumbled upon this meme. An auntie was saying, *"Sanskrit coding language banane wale hai"* ("People are making Sanskrit into a coding language"). And I thought, “Why not?” 🤔  

Then I remembered our Honourable Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s famous quote:  
*"Aapda ko avsar mein badalna hai"*  
("Turn adversity into opportunity").  

That’s when I decided to create my own programming language where the syntax is entirely in Sanskrit. Yes, **only Sanskrit**! 🕉️

## The Research Adventure 🚀  

Before diving into the code, I knew I needed to do my homework 📚. I went on a research spree, devouring every article, blog, and tutorial I could find about creating your own programming language.  

Here are some of the gems that guided me on this epic journey:  
- [The Programming Language Pipeline by freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-programming-language-pipeline-91d3f449c919/) – Absolute gold! 💛  
- [How to Build a New Programming Language by Peter Grandinetti](https://pgrandinetti.github.io/compilers/page/how-to-build-a-new-programming-language/) – Super detailed and helpful. 🙌  
- A huge shoutout to [Piyush Garg’s video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTuTLc_u6qw&t=642s) – I learned **so much** from this! 🧠💡  

If you’re ever curious about creating your own language, start here. Trust me, it’s worth it!

## The "Hello World" of Sanskrit 🌏  

Now, the fun part: actual coding! Instead of boring old `function`, we now have `कार्य` (kārya). And `console.log`? That’s `मुद्रण` (mudraṇ). Let me show you how it looks:  

```sanskrit
कार्य नमस्ते() {
    मुद्रण("नमस्ते विश्व!");
}

नमस्ते();
```

That’s right – we just said "Hello, World!" in Sanskrit 🕉️. Isn’t it cool?

## Features So Far ✨  

Here’s what the Sanskrit Programming Language can do right now:  
- **Write Code in Sanskrit**: Say goodbye to `if` and `else`, and hello to `यदि` and `अन्यथा`.  
- **Devanagari Support**: Whether you prefer १, २, ३ or 1, 2, 3, we’ve got you covered! 😉  
- **Functions**: Define and call your functions using Sanskrit syntax.  

Check this out:  

```sanskrit
कार्य योग(क, ख) {
    मुद्रण(क + ख);
}

योग(१०, २०);  // Outputs: ३०
योग(10, 20);  // Also works!
```

It’s like adding some ancient Indian magic 🪄 to your code!

## The Vision 🌟  

Why create a programming language in Sanskrit? Well, why not? 😏  
Here’s the big dream:  
1. Bridge the gap between ancient wisdom and modern tech. 🌉  
2. Preserve and promote Sanskrit in a fun, geeky way. 🕶️  
3. Make programming accessible to Sanskrit enthusiasts and learners. 📖

## What I Learned Along the Way 🧠  

Creating a programming language isn’t easy (duh! 😅), but it’s insanely rewarding. I learned how to build a lexer, parser, and compiler – all the nerdy stuff that makes coding magic happen.  

One article that really helped me was [The Programming Language Pipeline by freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-programming-language-pipeline-91d3f449c919/). If you’re even a tiny bit curious about how languages work, go read it. Like, right now. 🔗
